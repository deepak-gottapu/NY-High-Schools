Analyzing New York High School Data

New York City has a significant immigrant population, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups consistently performed better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.

This project is an attempt to identify the fairness of SAT test based on various parameters like race, school, demographics etc.
